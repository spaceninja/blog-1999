<BR>Last night I went to see the Flying Karamazov Brothers again. They're an amazing juggling act that started on the streets of San Francisco. They do an act that is focused on puns and expressing music visually. The last time I saw them was at the Civic with Steve, and they were amazing. They made mistakes, but they had a whole repertoire of jokes to cover themselves. It was awesome. They weren't quite up to par last night, though. I'm not sure how much that has to do with my having seen it before, and how much was due to them not doing too well. They seemed to make a lot more mistakes, and mess up their lines, and just not cover it up nearly as well. Still, on the whole, it was a cool show. Steve and I talked Miles and Annie into coming with us, and they both seemed to get a kick out of it.

<P>Today I cleaned the tek room. It was really a big mess, but after about four hours, it looks much better. Got the shelves cleaned off, got the equipment straightened up, and the garbage taken out. Now if they just vacuum the room, it'll look really sharp!

<P>That's about all my news for now. Nothing much else going on.
