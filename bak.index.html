<P><font color=red>NOTICE!!!
<br>I have stopped posting in this journal in favor of my journal on hatelife. To see it, you can click <a href="http://www.hatelife.org/view.php?user=obeso+the+pirate">here</a> or you can go to <a href="http://www.hatelife.org/">hatelife</a> and look for obeso the pirate (the name I keep my journal under). Enjoy!

<P>Hmm... Does a journal really need an introduction? Appearently so, since I'm sitting here writing one. Can I safely assume that you know what a journal is? Let's say you don't. This is my space to put down my thoughts. What I put down and how often I put them down varies wildly. Sometimes I really get into writing for the journal, and other times a month or two will go by before I update.

<P>I've recently discovered a certain voyeristic streak in me. My friend Jester put up a journal online after reading Microserfs. I really enjoyed reading his journal. I don't get to see him often enough and we're both pretty lazy about emailing each other, so it was cool to read what was going on in his life. At about the same time, I started visiting the infamous Jennicam. This is so addicting. The girl just lives out her life like normal. She's really not even that interesting. She's a computer geek web designer (sounds familiar), so almost all the time, you just see her sitting in front of her monitor. She also keeps a journal online. I don't know this woman at all, and yet I frequently read her diary.

<P>Like I said, it's an addiction. I'm not sure if it's a healthy one, but I've discovered that this voyeristic streak is there, and I don't see any real reason to discourage it. I'm not stalking anyone, I'm visiting websites. *shrugs* who knows. The point is, I've got a journal online now, too.

<P>In Microserfs, the narrator says, "I used to always think that I had to have a reason to record my observations of the day, or even my emotions, but now I think simply being alive is more than enough reason."
