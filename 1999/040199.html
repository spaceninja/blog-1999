<BR>Well, here I am again at work. I'm a little bored. I've certainly got plenty to do, but I just don't have any motivation to do it. I spent a good chunk of yesterday hanging out in the labs with Steve and Miles talking about our projects. It's so cool when we all get together like that… we all feed off each other's energy and then we all run back to our computers to quickly do as much work as we can before the excitement wears off. Mac Mutton Kombat is nearly done. It's Miles' game, but I sit around with him and try to help, so I feel kinda involved, and it makes happy to see it so near completion. I don't know how close Steve is to finishing the PC (Linux?) version, but he said it'd be done within two weeks… It looks like Miles and I are going to put up a web page called Mutton Studios, which will be the unofficial official homepage of MK. We'll post updates, extra stuff, and all sorts of kick ass stuff. On Friday, after movie night, we're all heading back to the Tek room to record sounds for the games. Steve asked me to create the splash screens for them. He wants a KMFDM album-cover style but with Pokey characters. I did some sketches last night and I think it's going to look fantastic! Sometime after Friday, Steve and I are going to pull together all the Y5 material, and then it'll just be a simple matter of waiting for the orders to roll in! We're offering the CD on Y5 as a post-mortem Dr. Colossus album-in-progress, with a bonus combat game featuring Pokey, and on Pokey we're advertising it as Mutton Kombat, featuring some sample tracks by Y5! It's going to rule.

<P>It looks like Annie and I are going to be pulling another three-weeks-apart stint. We were together for a week over spring break, so it shouldn't be too bad. This weekend is Easter, so we're getting together with out own families, next weekend, she's hanging out with her friend Heidi, so we'll be headed to Tacoma the weekend after for Zach's birthday. The movie night that I really want to go to is that weekend, which sucks, because that means that I'll be catching a bus after midnight, and showing up really really early on Saturday, then heading home around dinner time on Sunday. I really hope things work out with her moving to Portland next year. I'm tired of this every-other week thing we've got going on.

<P>I feel like writing a story, but I don't really have one in my head. I've got a semi-idea forming about something sorta sci-fi… but as you can no doubt tell by my ambiguity, I'm not too sure what it's about yet, and the desire to write may very well have left me by the time I figure it out.
