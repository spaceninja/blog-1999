<BR>What a weekend! I feel great! Well, actually, I feel kinda sick, but mentally and emotionally, I feel great! I just got back from a weekend in Ellensburg with Annie. She had been having a rough week, and was telling me that she was feeling pretty down because of all the reading she'd been doing (the news and her child abuse class textbook), so it was hard not to tell her that I had a ride to come see her, but I wanted it to be a surprise. And it worked! Andy picked me up at about 5:30 on Thursday and we drove and drove and finally got there (after being pulled over for speeding) at 11pm. She wasn't in her room, so I wandered over to Pat & Urn's place, which was the only other place she was likely to be (ran into Jessie on the way), but she wasn't there either. I was going to head back to her building to hang out with Jessie until she reappeared, but I hit the computer lab on the way to see if Pat or Urn were there and sure enough, Pat was. I stayed and talked with him for a few minutes, and he revealed that Becky knew that Andy was coming (with me), and had grabbed Annie earlier to wait with her (but luckily didn't tell Annie). About this point Annie ran in the door of the lab exclaiming "There you are!" It was great. She said she saw Andy wander in (they were waiting in Becky's room) and was kinda sad that I wasn't with him, and then Andy said he had just left me in the hallway, and she was off and running, hot on my trail. It was pretty funny. We had an awesome weekend, just hanging out and becoming less stressed. We watched <I>Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas</I>, which was even funnier the second time, and <I>The Slums of Beverly Hills</I>, which is all about a girl coming to terms with her breasts. Then we saw <I>Entrapment</I> the next day, which has a kinda unbeleivable ending, but is still really cool. We watched <I>X-Files</I> which was a cool episode, and even <I>Family Guy</I> had a few worthwhile jokes in it! I considered stealing one. The baby is happy because the Dad has set him free from the Teletubby trap, and he announces "I will remember your kind deed. When I take over the world, your death shall be swift and painless." I was going to redo my page of thanks and just say that to everyone, but I decided against it. Before I left, I managed to get my computer working almost perfectly (all my games run, but one resolution mode is still resisting me). I got a letter from Oregon Department of Revenue, and they said my check's in the mail, which means soon I will be able to get a computer upgrade, which I'm very excited about. Life is going good, on the whole. Except for this damn throat cold Annie gave me, and the fact that my Mom's getting tested for cancer stuff again. I better figure out something nice to do for Mother's day...
