<BR>Man, I did it again. Way too long since I last posted here. I have no idea where I left off... Halloween was awesome. I had THE BEST COSTUME IN THE WORLD! I dressed up as an Agent from <i>the Matrix</i>. When I told Annie my idea she got really excited and asked if she could dress up as Trinity. Like I would stop her from wearing something tight, shiny, and black... But the reason the costume was so brilliant was twofold. First, Agents are just badass... Secondly, It would be relatively cheap! I already own sunglasses (I never wear them... Steve and I bought these blues brothers sunglasses in highschool). The earpiece is $2 at Radio Shack. So the only thing I had to do was buy a cheap used black suit! This was something I'd been needing to do anyways. I needed new dress clothes since I *ahem* outgrew my others. So I went to this used place and found a great suit for $30, got it altered and patched up for $20 more, and I was good to go! (well, actually I needed to buy a new belt and tie, too, but once again, those are things I'll use elsewhere). So even though I put like $70 into this costume, I didn't mind, because it's all stuff I'll use again or already owned (with the exception of the earpiece). Even better, Steve ALSO owns a black suit and a matching pair of sunglasses! So we could dress up together! And Annie was going to find a tight black vynil outfit! Well, we got all dressed up and were really happy with how we looked (I even shaved my beard), and then Steve got pnumonia and couldn't make it. So we went to the party and everyone looked and me and said "Oh, it's another Man in Black!"... and they just looked at Annie and said "woah!". No one really got it, but it was still the best costume I saw at either party we went to, and easily the best costume I've ever come up with.

<P>School is going allright, although I'm getting very frustrated with it. It feels like busy work, and I've never been good at doing stuff I wasn't motivated at. Well, just this year left and then I'm done. I WILL stick it out and graduate. I WILL finish what I've started.

<P>Learned a new word the other day: "deist." I won't get into it now, but it's fitting in really well with my still-developing ideas on religion.

<P>I had my first review at work a few days ago, and it was awesome! Appearently I've been doing a great job!

<P>I saw <I>Fight Club</I>. What a mindfuck! I'm definitely going back, and this movie is HIGHLY recommended to anyone who's reading this. It's so much more than just a bunch of guys beating each other up, like the preview makes it out to be. This is a great movie. This is as higly ranked in my book as Blues Brothers, Matrix, and Star Wars are in each of their respective areas. Just a stunning movie. I'm also going to go see <I>Being John Malkovitch</I> this weekend, which I hear is great, and next weekend, I'm seeing <I>Princess Mononoke</I>, which I've heard is the best selling anime of all time in Japan (or the best selling movie of all time in Japan, I don't remember which).

<P>That's it for now. I'll try to write more soon, maybe on some of my religion ideas...
