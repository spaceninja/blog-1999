<P>3.19.99
<BR>It's 4am. I'm wide awake and in the computer lab. Why am I wide awake? Well, because I stayed up all night last night and didn't go to bed until 9am, and then got up at 4pm, so I've only been up for 12 hours, naturally! Why am I in the computer lab? Well, to be honest, I can't think of any good reason to leave. I've been here since 6pm, the lab closed at 10pm, and I've been sort of working on web site stuff ever since then. I haven't been getting much done, though, since Miles is here, too, and he's working on "Mutton Kombat," a Street Fighter style game using Pokey the Penguin characters, and it's amusing as hell to watch him work on it. The game is just like the comic. Neurotic. I heard Miles state earlier that "We have escaped quality. We have transcended it." How very true.

<P>I'm wide awake and having fun, and I have every intention of staying here until 8am, when the labs open again. I start working at 10am, so that's not entirely unreasonable. I think I'll go get some breakfast with Miles at some point, though.

<P>Finals are finally over, and I don't have to do anything tomorrow (today) except work. Sometime in the evening, I'm supposed to be picked up by Annie to head to the beach, but plans are still not finalized. She's still hunting down transportation.

<P>:D There's something kick ass about fighting a giant snowman with a red devil penguin!
