<br>Yarrrr... (I say that quite a bit... Pirate noises are the best). Well, since I last updated, the term has ended successfully! Out of my three classes this term, not one of them had a traditional final. Graphic Design III had a large final project which was due last week, and then we didn't meet during finals week at all. American History gave me a take home final. That's right. A TAKE-HOME final. Oh my god. I thought that I had seen the last of those (and multiple-guess tests) in high school. Oh man. It was great. Two essays on stuff I hadn't read, but I had plenty of time to research the material right in the text. And then in my Capstone class, we had a final presentation on some really simple concepts, and our last class was just doing those presentations. Really informal, there was food. It was cool. And yet, even though I didn't have any traditional finals, I'm glad to see this term gone by. Only two left now.

<p>I'm broke again. That sucks. I thought I had a couple hundred dollars left to buy Christmas presents with. I stopped by the ATM... $10. AAAGH! How did I miscalculate that badly? Oh well... Annie's agreed to loan me what I need in exchange for me paying her half of rent next month.

<p>As the term ended, I got more and more wrapped up in getting stuff done. Then I got really really sick over Thanksgiving. Following that, I was too busy doing schoolwork to clean. Then Annie got a touch of what I had, or something different and was sick for several days in a row. Needless to say, the house was a wreck. Garbage all over, papers piled up on the counter, food all over, not a single clean dish in the house. It sucked. Usually, our place is pretty clean, but we just couldn't clean. So finally, yesterday, we just sat down and did it. Annie did the dishes, and I picked up everything else and when we got done, our house was livable again! Then she baked chocolate chip cookies!

<p>I had the greatest week ever at work last week. Our boss came in and informed us that there was a big pile of surplus computers in the back room that he would let us gut if we wanted. They were all 486s, and we couldn't take the cases for legal reasons, but the motherboard and all the other components were ours for free! All we had to do was take them apart! Miles and I together snagged about 13 machines, total. Miles got a few Macs in there, and all the rest are PCs. Now, most of them won't work (they were surplus for a reason), but if we can even get four or five functioning machines out of this, we can put Linux on them and buy a cheap case, and we've gotten fully functional computers for free! The parts are lying on my floor in a box right now, waiting for me to inspect them and pass judgement. I can't wait.

<p>Tons of good ideas on websites lately. Steve and I are working on a new idea to put up on all the front pages of our sites. We came up with a new logo(s) for Fojar that I'm going to work on. I already put up a new front page for <a href="http://www.yellow5.com/">yellow5.com</a>. Miles and I aquired <a href="http://bigbad.fojar.com/">big bad fojar</a> and <a href="http://bigbad.spaceninja.com/">big bad spaceninja</a> to make competing propaganda sites. I'm working on the new CNS page for work. I'm having fun. In the words of Tank from the Matrix: "It's a very exciting time!"

<p>And hopefully, now that it's the break, our team will make some progress on Cube Fighter! If you have no idea what I'm talking about, visit <a href="http://play.fojar.com/">play.fojar.com</a>. I'm really excited about the concept, even if Jester thinks we're wasting our time. What does that punk know anyway? Just because he's got a job in the "real" game industry. ;)
