3.1.99.11am
<BR>Question: Am I the only person who snickers when they see a "Gonzaga University" sweatshirt? Surely someone else must have seen <I>Encino Man</I>!! Maybe it's just me.

<P>There's something strange about today. The world just seems kind of... off. It's like everything got shifted three inches to the left while I was sleeping, but when I woke up, everything had been moved, so I didn't notice it, other than just a strange feeling. I can't put my finger on it. I just feel strange. It's one of those days where you look outside and it's bright and sunny, but cold and overcast at the same time. We had a lightning storm last night, which is pretty rare here, so it was cool. I got to bed early, so it's not lack of sleep (maybe I got too much?). I woke up and the curtains were open, which was odd. Aaron never opens the curtains in the morning. So it was strange to wake up to a really bright room (our window faces east).

<P>I really can't figure it out. Things are just strange. I bet people are wondering why I'm wandering around campus peering suspiciously at everyone, as if any moment I might find out who did this. But since I don't know what "this" is, all I'm doing is peering suspiciously.

<P>Oh man. This is just going to be one of those days.

<P>Life is busy. There are two weeks left before finals, and I'm hitting the usual choke point, where I'm starting to realize exactly how much work I have to complete in that time. I'm not worried, because this happens every term, and by now I know that this is when I start getting things done, but it is stressful.

<P>I'm looking forward to Spring Break. I'm taking a bunch of people to the beach cabin. My family has a cabin in Twin Rocks, a nice little beach near Tillamook that no one's ever heard of, so it's a great place to go. We'll head up and do the usual. Stay the whole weekend, make a big spaghetti dinner one night, visit the cheese factory, and have a bonfire on the beach. I can't wait to get down there and take a long walk down the shore with Annie. It's funny how little things like that begin to sound infinitely appealing when you don't have access to them.
