<BR>I'm in a thoughtful mood at the moment. I've been reading the fourth book in Whitley Steiber's <I>Communion</I> series. It's called <I>The Secret School</I>, and it's about visitor encounters he had as a nine-year-old. He talks about when he had a severe fever (107 degrees) that lasted several days. Everyone thought he was going to die, and he remembers the preist coming and giving him confession. He remembers meeting "Eddie." a young boy who played with him in his room. Eddie said he was here to take him, once he died. He had a sense that he could play with Eddie after that. When he asked Eddie what his last name was, Eddie replied "Oh, Death." They wrestled, and eventually, as the fever died Eddie left, but not before he had a peek at the gates of heaven and St. Peter. He remembers St. Peter as a very large man in a blue uniform with a baseball cap.

<P>This really interests me. I've felt for quite awhile that various religions are simply different ways of viewing the same underlying reality. Is it possible that none of us really comprehends what happens after we die, so all religions spring out of various ideas? And as we are raised in various systems of thought, we view that reality differently. This would explain why a nine-year-old, who had been raised Catholic, would see what he expected to when he was near death, but saw it his own way. Death, rather than the traditional image he hadn't been exposed to, was a young child who played with him, and St. Peter wore a baseball cap. It's an interesting theory. I think it's the closest I've come to a religious idea that I could agree with.

<P>In other news, I managed to break my artist's block. Annie did some poses for me while watching TV last night and I started drawing again, which was great. I'm going to try and start doing some sketches every night for about a half hour. I also managed to come up with two news stories for Y5, and a new logo for Space Ninja, a task that has been haunting me for awhile now. Hopefully by this evening, I'll have a start on a new interface for SpaceNinja and all will be going well. :)
