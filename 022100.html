<br>I'm getting caught up, slowly but surely. I finally got caught up in Modern East Asia, and hopefully I'll do well on the final to counterbalance the F I got on the midterm. I also just got caught up in Graphic Design III, so I'm doing well there. My Intership class is a cakewalk, all I have to do I attend the internship and do a decent job and I'll pass. So now I just have my Sophomore Inquiry to catch up in. I'm unbelievably behind in there. It's pathetic. In fact, I should be doing that and not updating this journal.
